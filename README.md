I am a Software Engineer based out of the Bay Area. I am thrilled to be transitioning to a career in tech as a software engineer. I completed a programming bootcamp for women and non-binary folk for that gave me a strong foundation in full stack technologies and am eager to apply those skills in a professional setting.

I am a creator. My educational background is in music, and over my lifetime, I have taught myself many art forms. Programming has been the natural next step in this progression. I am happiest when I am creating. Let's make something together!
